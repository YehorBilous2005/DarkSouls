                    Dark Souls 3 takes place in a transitory place, revolving around 
                    the first flame and the cycle of fire and dark. You play as a 
                    protagonist whose goal is to find and return the five Lords of 
                    Cinder to their thrones at Firelink Shrine in order to link the 
                    flame again. The protagonist is known as an Unkindled, a kind of 
                    Undead, although it is never fully enunciated upon what differentiates 
                    an Unkindled from other Undead. There are implications that an 
                    Unkindled is the remains of an Undead warrior who failed to link 
                    the flame and, as a result, burned their bodies into ash.

                    The five Lords of Cinder are Ludleth the Exiled; Aldrich, Saint 
                    of the Deep; Farron's Undead Legion, the Abyss Watchers; the 
                    reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital, Yhorm the Giant; and 
                    Holy King Lothric, Last Hope of His Line. Lords of Cinder are 
                    past beings who were successful in linking the flame, being burned 
                    remnants of their past selves.
