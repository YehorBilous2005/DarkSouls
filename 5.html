                    Once you have defeated the 4 Lords of Cinder and 
                    placed their ashes on their empty thrones, speak 
                    to the Fire Keeper, then activate the Bonfire, 
                    which will lead to a cutscene. Afterwards, you 
                    will be transported to the first Bonfire at the 
                    Kiln of the First Flame, which looks like a dark 
                    copy of Firelink Shrine.

                    Take the path outside and activate the bonfire 
                    to proceed to the First Flame. Upon arriving, 
                    light the Bonfire to the right, head up the path 
                    and enter the clearing to battle the Soul of 
                    Cinder. Defeat him to earn Soul of the Lords. 
                    Be wary that it is possible to invade at the 
                    path, before the fog gate. Activating the 
                    Bonfire in front warps to Dreg Keep instead.

                        3. In order to reach this area, the player 
                        must first kill all Lords of Cinder and speak 
                        to the Fire Keeper in Firelink Shrine. 
                        Interacting with the Firelink bonfire will then
